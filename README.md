  - `CurrencyPipe`: Format currency values.
  - `DecimalPipe`: Format decimal numbers.
  - `PercentPipe`: Display percentages.
  - `AsyncPipe`: Handle observable data effortlessly.
  - `SlicePipe`: Slice and display array or string elements.
  - `Custom Pipes`: Custom implementation of pipes catering to specific needs.

- **PrimeNG UI Framework:**
  - Integration of PrimeNG components throughout the application for responsive and appealing UI elements.
  - Utilization of PrimeFlex for enhanced layout and styling options.
